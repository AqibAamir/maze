The script generates and manages mazes in several ways. Here's a quick overview:

    Maze Creation: Generate a maze with specified dimensions using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim's algorithm, or a random method.
    Maze Visualization: Print the maze with customizable symbols and styles. You can also save or export it in text, CSV, or JSON formats.
    Maze Solving: Solve the maze manually by navigating with keyboard inputs or automatically using the algorithm. You can view the solution path and solve time.
    Maze Analysis: Analyze the maze for statistics such as wall and passage counts, dead ends, loops, and difficulty.
    User Interaction: Save user preferences, configure maze themes, log events, and load previous settings. The script also offers a user manual for guidance.
